# I/O 2019 and a11y

I care very much about making truly accessible apps, so naturally the first session for I/O ‘19 I watched was “What’s new in Android accessibility?” 🐱 here are my key takeaways:

- Live Transcribe 📝 is an app that adds captions - live, to any speech synthesised by the mic! When captions appear, the UX is amazingly accessible with high contrast, large text options available. [Live Transcribe](https://play.google.com/store/apps/detailsid=com.google.audio.hearing.visualization.accessibility.scribe)

- The a11y suite now ships with captioning for videos even in the photos app. This is possible through recurrent neural networks within your device - your data never leaves your phone! 🤖

- Talkback’s context menu now has a search option. This lets you jump to a cta or sub-section within the view rather than having to navigate the entire screen 📺 [Accessibility Suite](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.marvin.talkback)

- Voice access enhancements make a dotted overlay appear over your device so it can be controlled via voice, just like using Google assistant! 🤳 (bit experimental IMHO) [Voice Access](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.accessibility.voiceaccess)
